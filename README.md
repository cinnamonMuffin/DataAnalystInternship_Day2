# DataAnalystInternship_Day2
Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling


For my second day of the Data Analyst Internship, I was tasked to study a dataset and create create visualisations conveying a compelling story, using a tool such as Tableau/PowerBi.

Ive had some brief prior experience with PowerBi but I chose to use Tableau so I could learn it sna get some of the basics down. I created 4 different visualisations showing different trends and then created a final dashboard overview showcasing them all together.

The first visualisation consisted of a bar chart showing the trend of Sales across different Regions. I also ended up adding a line to show profit trends.

The second visualisation which used a colored bar chart to show Sales among each category of products.

The third one was similar to first but instead of capturing Sales across regions, it shows lines of Sales and Profit along a Time axis.

The last one is a Scatterplot map showing Discount vs Profit trends of different categories of products distinguished by color. It emphasises the number of products by the size of dots.

Finally, Ive also included a dashboard overview showing all four visualisations.

Thank You.
